# Overview

This is a refactor of oc-mirror v using SOLID design principles

- Single responisibility principle
- Open/Close principle
- Liskov substitution principle
- Interface segregation principle
- Dependency Inversion principle

I have included a simple imgesetconfig (isc.yaml) and deleteimagesetconfig (del-isc.yaml) for
initial testing
